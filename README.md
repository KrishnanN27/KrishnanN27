- 🔭 Currently, I'm engaged in research at the **DataDrivenCPS lab**, guided by my advisor, Dr. Gabe Fierro. Find out more about our lab [here](https://datadrivencps.github.io/website/).

- 🌱 I am deeply involved in research focusing on **accelerating SHACL validation and inference in RDF graphs**, treating these processes as dataflow. This work aims to optimize the underlying operations and improve the implementation of specific SHACL operations.
